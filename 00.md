# Preface
Faster CPUs and bigger dataset improves results of AI.

--

It's possible to develop an AI application without any code.

Practices for traditional AI app- systematic experimentation, rigorous evaluation, relentless optimization are still best practices.
RAG(Retrieval-augmented generation) has powered search and recommender systems.

The scale and improved capabilities of AI models require new solutions.

Adapt foundation models to solve real-world problems: tried-and-true.

## What This Book Is About
- Should I build this AI application?
- How to evaluate my app? Can I use AI to evaluate AI outputs?
- What causes hallucinations? How to detect and mitigate hallucinations?
- The best practices for prompt engineering?
- Why does RAG work? The strategies for doing RAG?
- What's an agent? How do I build and evaluate an agent?
- When to finetune a model? When not to finetune a model?
- How much data do I need? How to validate the quality of it?
- How to make my model faster, cheaper and secure?
- How to create a feedback loop to improve app continually?

## What This Book Is Not
It doesn't teach you how to use a tool.

It's not an ML theory book, is a practical book that helps you build AI apps to solve real-world problems.

Some useful concepts:
- Probabilistic concepts: sampling, determinism, and distribution
- ML concepts: supervision, self-supervision, log-likelihood, gradient descent, backpropagation, loss function, and hyperparameter tuning.
- Neural network architectures: feedforward, recurrent, and transformer
- Metrics: accuracy, F1, precision, recall, cosine similarity and cross entropy

## Who This Book Is For

## Navigating This Book
This book is modular so you can skip any section.

Chapter1: Is the AI app necessary? A range of use cases about what foundation models can do.

Chapter2: Analyzes the making of foundation model, design decisions, how a model generates a response.

Chapter3,4: explore different evaluation methods and create a reliable and systematic evaluation pipeline for your app.
The quality of response depends on:
- The instruction for how the model should behave
- The context the model can use
- The model itself

Chapter5(The instruction): prompt engineering, how to protect it from bad actors.

Chapter6(The context): RAG(better understood and work well in production), agentic pattern(more powerful, more complex)

Chapter7(model): changing the model with finetuning

Chapter8: Data: data acquisition, annotations, synthesis, processing

Chapter9: make its inference cheaper and faster

chapter10: brings different concepts together and build an application end-to-end
