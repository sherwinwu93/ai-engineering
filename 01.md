# 1. Introduction to Building AI Applications with Foundation Models
AI models consumes a nonotrivial portion of the world's electricity and runs out of internet data.

Two major consequences:
1. AI models are capable of more tasks.
2. A few organizations offer model as a service.

AI engineering makes the barrier lower.

## The Rise of AI Engineering

### From Language Models to Large Language Models

### From Large Language Models to Foundation Models

Gemini and GPT are better characterized as foundation models.

AI research used to be divided by data modalities.
NLP: only text
Computer vision: vision
Text-only: translation and spam detection
Image-only: object detection and image classification
Audio-only: TTS

Prompt engineering, RAG, and finetuning are three AI engineering techniques.

Build your own model or leverage an existing one.

### From Foundation Models to AI Engineering

## Foundation Model Use Cases

### Coding

### Image and Video Production

### Writing

### Education

### Conversational Bots

### Information Aggregation

### Data Organization

### Workflow Automation

## Planning AI Applications

### Use Case Evaluation

### Setting Expectations

### Milestone Planning

### Maintenance

## The AI Engineering Stack

### Three Layers of the AI Stack

### AI Engineering Versus ML Engineering

### AI Engineering Versus Full-Stack Engineering

## Summary
Two purposes:
1. regard AI engineering as a discipline, thanks to foundation models
2. offer an overview of process to build applications on these models

Transition from language models to LLM, to FM, to AI engineering

Most successful application patterns for consumers and enterprises.
